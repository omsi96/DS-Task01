For this task, we will go through a simple **Fruit Dataset** and use **Pandas** to display the different Fruit types (apple, mandarin, orange, and lemon) in our dataset.

## How to use the starter file?

- Fork and clone [this repo](https://github.com/SimoCs/Task01) to your `tasks` folder in your device.
- You can go to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and click on **Upload** choose the  `"Task 01.ipynb"`.
- Read the starter notebook carefully, there are some code blocks you need to fill.

## Basic Requirements 🍋

1. Create a **data frame** using dataset file `data.txt`. 
2. Calculate the **Number of Instances** and **Number of Attributes** of the fruit dataset.
3. Display the first **8** instances of the fruit dataset.

   > 💡**Tip**
   > Use the `.` operator after every statement in your Python code to display the available methods you can use.

## (Bonus) Extra Requirements 🤼‍

1. Display how many instances of `apple`(encoded 1), `mandarin`(encoded 2), `orange`(encoded 3), and `lemon`(encoded 4))

## (Extra Bonus) Styling 🎨

1. Using the `#` operator add **comment** to every code block you wrote explaining the logic behind your code.
